Console Blackjack game
=================

This is the console Blackjack game made for lessons 1 and 2 of Ruby on Rails Online Bootcamp (Tealeaf Academy).

I've made this blackjack game in two versions. The first version was procedurally coded, it works fine but still has some issues. It can be found in the [blackjack-procedural](blackjack-procedural/) folder.

The second version has been transformed into a Object Oriented version with much of the previous issues fixed. It works well and has better ASCII art. It can be found in the [blackjack-oop](blackjack-oop/) folder.
