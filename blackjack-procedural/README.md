Console Blackjack game
=================

Simple Blackjack game made for lesson 1 of Ruby on Rails Online Bootcamp (Tealeaf Academy).

### Requirements

Please note a minimal console width of 154 characters is required for running the Blackjack game!

### Known issues

 * The game doesn't recognize a player's or a dealer's instant Blackjack.
 * The game supports up to 5 cards per player. It can display more cards but the center will shift.
 * Only two players are supported, one of those being the dealer
 * Cards are chosen at random, the game doesn't track one or more deck of cards. This makes it possible to draw exactly the same cards but prevents card counting :-)
